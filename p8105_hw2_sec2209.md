## Problem 1

In this code chunk, I read in the Mr. Trash Wheel data, clean variable
names, omit non-data entries and rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data, and change the number of sports balls variable
to an integer.

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

In the next portion of the exercise, I read in the monthly precipitation
data for 2018 and 2017. In this step, I omit rows without precipitation
data and create a year variable.

``` r
precipitation_18 = 
  read_excel(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precipitation_17 = 
  read_excel(
    "./Data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

In the next code chunk I combine the annual precipitation over 2018 and
2017 and create a month character variable.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precipitation_df =
  bind_rows(precipitation_18, precipitation_17)

left_join(precipitation_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

The Mr. Trash Wheel data set represents trash that has been removed from
the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland by the Mr. Trash Wheel vessel.
The data set contains information on the amount of trash collected by
each dumpster by month and year, breaking down specific types of trash
items. The Mr. Trash Wheel data set contains 344 observations. The
median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

The Mr. Trash Wheel data also contains monthly precipitation data. The
resulting precipitation data set for 2018 and 2017 contains 24
observations. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 and the total
precipitation in 2017 was 32.93.

## Problem 2

The next problem explores the NYC Transit data on subway station
entrances and exits.

In the following code chunk, I read in the NYC Transit data, retaining:

  - line
  - station name
  - latitude / longitude
  - routes served
  - entry
  - vending
  - entrance type
  - ADA compliance

I also convert entry from a character variable (*YES* vs. *NO*) to a
logical variable (*YES = TRUE* vs. *NO = FALSE*).

``` r
nyc_transit = 
  read_csv(
    "./Data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE),
         route8 = as.character(route8),
         route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10),
         route11 = as.character(route11),
         )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The NYC Transit data contains information on the NYC subway stations,
including their locations, routes they serve, among other station
characteristics and services. In the data cleaning steps above, I retain
only the necessary variables for the analysis, clean the variable names,
covert the entry variable from character to logical, and convert all
route variables to character. The resulting data set contains 1868
observations and 19 variables. There are 465 distinct stations within
the data and only 465 are ADA compliant. A total of 39% of stations
without vending allow entrance.

These data are not tidy. There is redundancy in observations down rows
and multiple columns that represent the route variable. In the following
code chunk, I tidy these data by making route number and route name
distinct variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    nyc_transit,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route",
  ) %>%
  drop_na(route) %>%
  distinct()
```

The resulting data set contains 1559 observations and 10 variables. A
total of 60 distinct stations serve the A train, of which only 17 are
ADA compliant.
